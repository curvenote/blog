This week on Thursday, we hosted a webinar to take people through [our latest publishing capabilities](https://curvenote.com/blog/one-click-publishing-for-open-research).

## Scientific publishing with Curvenote

Over the last few months, weâ€™ve built out an ability to publish rich scientific websites from content written in [curvenote.com](https://curvenote.com) or in Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks.

While focused on publishing via our [Command Line Interface](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli) for some time, we recently enabled publishing direct from [curvenote.com](https://curvenote.com), and that is what our webinar this week focussed on - one-click, no-code website publishing. This feature enables a whole other set of researchers to publish their work with Curvenote, those who prefer working via a web interface rather than `yaml` and `md`.

You can watch the [webinar recording on YouTube](https://youtu.be/KhEReBPDang) of learn more on our [blog post about the webinar](https://curvenote.com/blog/one-click-publishing-for-open-research).
