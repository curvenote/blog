This week released our export templates and have released this for PDFs. It has been a long-awaited feature that we've been heads down on, but the first glimpse of our new export facility is here and available in the app.

We take a look and dive in deep to talk about the templating mini-language and python utility that we're about to put out there next, that'll allow people to create, or port existing templates and submit them to our community repo, where theyâ€™ll then become accessible in Curvenote.
