This week we look at some of the new export templates that have been added to Curvenote recently and the templating command-line tool that we have just pushed to pypi. Curvenote now has single and two column templates suitable for preprints on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/) and the full template for the [Volcanica Journal](http://www.jvolcanica.org/ojs/index.php/volcanica).

The release notes for that are below 👇

We need to add some options to make these fully functional and submission-ready for both PDF and $\LaTeX$ exports, but already these are close and usable for drafting and initial sumissions.
