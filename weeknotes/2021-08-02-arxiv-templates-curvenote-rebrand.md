```{note} Press Release
Read the press release on [Curvenote Unveils New Product & Brand](../news/curvenote-unveils-new-product-and-brand.md).
```

This week we look at some of the new export templates that have been added to Curvenote recently and the templating command-line tool that we have just pushed to pypi. Curvenote now has single and two column templates suitable for preprints on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/) and the full template for the [Volcanica Journal](http://www.jvolcanica.org/ojs/index.php/volcanica).

The release notes for that are below ðŸ‘‡

## Aug 6, 2021 - New Export Templates

We have deployed a set of templates this week including:

- arXix - single and two column
- EarthArXiv - single and two column
- AGU Journal format
- Volcanica Journal

We need to add some options to make these fully functional and submission-ready for both PDF and $\LaTeX$ exports, but already these are close and usable for drafting and initial sumissions.

This week we are also working through a rebrand of Curvenote and website that we are planning to launch in a few weeks!
