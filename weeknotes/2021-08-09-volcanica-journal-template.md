This week was an impromptu workflow walkthrough of the editing and export experience with a user who is publishing in the [Volcanica journal](https://curvenote.com/templates/volcanica). We got asked some great questions on how Curvenote handles various things including code, figure layout versus text positioning, full-width figures, and more. Some of this is already on our todo list but it was great to add another couple of things and get confirmation on our priority calls.

We released the [Volcanica template](https://curvenote.com/templates/volcanica) that you can access directly from Curvenote.
