This week we released a feature where you can directly publish from Curvenote using the Publish button in the top right of any project. You will be prompted to setup subdomains, which are hosted on `*.curve.space`, and can have the form of `username.curve.space` or `username-project.curve.space`.

Once your content is ready, you can publish it to the domains that you have listed by clicking the publish button. The process of deploying the site takes a few seconds, and then you will be able to browse to your new website! üöÄ

## Deprecating ‚ÄúAdvanced Publishing‚Äù

As a part of these publishing updates we are deprecating ‚ÄúAdvanced Publishing‚Äù which allowed you to only publish a portion of your project. If your project is using this setting, you will see a warning and have the option to choose either `Private` (the default) or `Public` visibility. We will officially deprecate this in the coming weeks.

We have also turned off search-engine indexing for projects directly on Curvenote and there will be additional changes to public projects in the future. More functionality will be going into the site-based publishing over time!

## Weeknotes from the Archive

This week we also released a lot of our previous notes that you can now see on our weeknotes on a spiffy new landing page at <https://curvenote.com/weeknotes>.
