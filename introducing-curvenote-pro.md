As we continue to add new features, improvements and templates we are introducing [Curvenote Pro](https://curvenote.com/pricing), which includes additional private projects, advanced publishing, and export to any professional template (including Word in the coming months!). Curvenote Pro has a two-week free trial for you to explore all the options, you can find out more [here](https://curvenote.com/pricing).

For the fantastic community members that have supported us along our journey so far, we are offering an additional six months free on our annual plan, you can claim that any time in the next month by visiting your settings in Curvenote. Also, for the coming two months we will offer 25% off both the monthly and annual price for all users.

We look forward to continuing to make Curvenote the best place for technical writing over the coming months!

Thank you all for your support! ðŸš€

**Additional Details**

As a part of these updates some of you have already created private projects or have turned on features which are included in Curvenote Pro, there will be **no changes to the privacy settings of your projects**, even if they exceed the Community Plan. Projects which exceed the limits will continue to work until Dec 15, 2021 and then will be set to read-only. Additionally, private projects and those projects with advanced publishing options will be set to read-only if you decide to cancel your plan.
