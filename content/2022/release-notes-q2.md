# 2022-Q2

## Apr 25, 2022 Curvenote Blog

We have moved our Curvenote blog over to using our own publishing infrastructure, which means that it has moved to a subdomain: <https://blog.curvenote.com>

The site is super fast to load, and can handle all of the writing that we can throw at it, including references, figures, equations, and more. Our previous blogging seemed pretty constrained and really forced us to [copy-and-paste](https://curvenote.com/oxa:AVQ2dzLNloEd25Io8NbA/m2K31HsBqvCglJacduZU) content around the place, which didn’t feel right.

Stay tuned for more updates on our new publishing infrastructure over the coming month! 🚀

## Apr 21, 2022 - Link Cards 🃏

We have added cards that you can now use to link to pages in your Curvenote project.

For example, you can now link to other pages in this project:

```{link-block} oxa:9Kv3iYv0uCgaG0zl4WDZ/LSP3vg3i6ez1uALQaTW4

```

```{link-block} oxa:9Kv3iYv0uCgaG0zl4WDZ/dPPeRbnMco3YbcraaZY8

```

To create a card, use the `[[` syntax to link to an article or notebook, and then use the dropdown to change from a `Link` view to a `Card` view. 🎉 .

### Feature Improvements

- The MyST Markdown export is now compliant with the [MyST Spec](https://spec.myst.tools/). We will have a lot more to say about this soon! 🚀
