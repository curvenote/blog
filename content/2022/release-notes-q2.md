# 2022-Q2

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:9Kv3iYv0uCgaG0zl4WDZ/vzXz0yIA0wnPQIMqirql.2"}

## Apr 21, 2022 - Link Cards üÉè

We have added cards that you can now use to link to pages in your Curvenote project.

For example, you can now link to other pages in this project:

```{link-block} oxa:9Kv3iYv0uCgaG0zl4WDZ/LSP3vg3i6ez1uALQaTW4

```

```{link-block} oxa:9Kv3iYv0uCgaG0zl4WDZ/dPPeRbnMco3YbcraaZY8

```

To create a card, use the `[[` syntax to link to an article or notebook, and then use the dropdown to change from a `Link` view to a `Card` view. üéâ .
