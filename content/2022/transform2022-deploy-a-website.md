# Creating & Sharing Scientific Websites

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:AVQ2dzLNloEd25Io8NbA/9NhlFdURPgqqpox69RV3.1"}

We were excited to help support the [Transform 2022 conference](https://transform.softwareunderground.org/) this year, and work to showcase a lot of the amazing science that is going on in the subsurface geoscience community.

We gave two lightning talks at the event, one on a demo of deploying a scientific website in 4.5 minutes ‚è≤Ô∏è , and a talk on some highlights that Steve wanted to share from the [Force11 Conference](https://curvenote.com/oxa:AVQ2dzLNloEd25Io8NbA/B4wmnvPyzVyBNQ8vHZpG) that we sponsored in 2021.

## Create a scientific website in 5 min! ‚è±

In three easy steps:

1. üß± Have content & notebooks: `curvenote init`
2. ‚å®Ô∏è Work locally with markdown: `curvenote start`
3. üåç Share it with the world: `curvenote deploy`

I actually got the full demo done in 2 minutes and 54 seconds. üöÄ

### N things I learned at Force11

See the original blog post on [Steve Purves blog](https://www.stevejpurves.com/blog/t22-lightning-talk-n-things-i-learned-at-force-11). Some of the points that he covers are:

- Citations files: [Citation File Format](<https://citation-file-format.github.io/#:~:text=cff%20files%20are%20plain%20text,to%20correctly%20cite%20their%20software.&text=The%20format%20of%20CITATION.,Citation%20File%20Format%20(CFF).>)
- Contributor roles: <https://casrai.org/credit/>
- Zenodo ‚áî Github Bridge: <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content>
- OpenAlex APIs for scholarly data: [https://openalex.org](https://openalex.org/)

So much amazing work going on in the community!
