The need for interactive and explorable content has changed scientific publishing significantly in the last 20 years. The Jupyter project is one of the main advances in the production of ‚Äúliving‚Äù scientific documents. Jupyter Notebooks are one of the most popular computational notebook formats among academic researchers and data scientists.

Curvenote is a tool for [scientific writing](https://curvenote.com/for/writing) and publishing that [integrates directly with Jupyter notebooks](https://curvenote.com/for/jupyter). One of Curvenote‚Äôs many strengths is its easy-to-use reference management. References can be uploaded as a BibTeX (`.bib`) file, a structured format that stores bibliographic information.

But, how do you quickly create a BibTeX file containing your references for your Curvenote project? [Paperpile](http://paperpile.com/) offers two solutions to this problem‚Äîone simple, and one that is a bit more technical.

**But first, what is Paperpile?**

Paperpile is a web-based reference management tool that offers BibTeX support and dynamic integration with external platforms. You can collect, store, and organize your references, all in one app. Reference lists can be easily exported to `.bib` files.

With Paperpile, you can:

- [Collect references fast](https://paperpile.com/features/collect-papers/). You can search across major databases like Google Scholar and ArXiv, or use the browser extension to get the PDF and accurate metadata in just one click;
- [Organize your research library](https://paperpile.com/features/reference-manager/) using folders and labels. Folders provide hierarchical structure, whereas [labels offer a more flexible method for grouping papers](https://paperpile.com/blog/whats-new-with-labels/);
- View and [annotate PDFs](https://paperpile.com/features/pdf-annotator/);
- Customize BibTeX output.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll show you how to create a `.bib` file for your Curvenote project in two ways so that you can benefit from all the conveniences of Paperpile.

The first way shows you how to generate a static BibTeX file using Paperpile that can be uploaded to the Curvenote web app, but the file needs to be manually updated each time you change or add new references.

The second way requires you to install the Curvenote CLI and creates a dynamic integration between Paperpile and Curvenote.

We describe both use-cases through simple step-by-step guides. But first, we show you how to collect and organize your references in Paperpile.

## Managing your references with Paperpile

To organize your papers, we recommend only including the references that you need for your Curvenote project, and using the full reference management capabilities of Paperpile. This is easy to do by creating a folder that contains all the references for your project.

To create a new folder in Paperpile, follow these steps:

1. In the left-hand toolbar in the Paperpile web app, go to _FOLDERS_ > click the plus symbol _Add new folder_

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-plus-button.png
   :align: center
   :width: 50%

   In your folders, click the plus symbol to add a new folder.
   ```

2. Name your new folder, and _click Create Folder_

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-new-folder.png
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

   Name and create a new folder in Paperpile.
   ```

3. Add references to your folder. You can add papers by searching online, [uploading PDFs](https://paperpile.com/features/pdf-manager/), BibTeX or other files, browsing online databases, or by manual input of citations. References can also be collected using the Paperpile browser extension.

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-add-papers.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

   Add references to your new folder by uploading PDFs.
   ```

Now, your references are organized in a folder, where you can order your papers hierarchically using subfolders, sort and filter papers by specific criteria, add notes to papers, and [use the notes to generate paper summaries](https://paperpile.com/features/pdf-annotator/). Next, we show you two ways to add the references in your Paperpile folder to your Curvenote project.

## A simple step-by-step guide to creating a BibTeX file for a Curvenote project in the web app

We describe how to export a BibTeX file from Paperpile and import it to the Curvenote web app in two steps:

**Step 1: Export the BibTeX file to your desktop**

To download the folder containing your references as a BibTeX file, select the downarrow next to the folder > _Export_ > _BibTeX_

```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-export-bibtex.png
:align: center
:width: 95%

Download any Paperpile folder as a BibTeX file.
```

**Step 2: Import the BibTeX file to your Curvenote project**

1. In the bottom-left corner of your project, click _REFERENCE MANAGEMENT_

   ```{figure} paperpile/curvenote-reference-manager.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

   Easily import references in Curvenote using the Reference Management tool.
   ```

2. Click _UPLOAD BIBTEX_ to add the BibTeX (`.bib`) file to your project:

   ```{figure} paperpile/curvenote-upload.png
   :align: center
   :width: 95%
   Upload your BibTeX references to Curvenote.
   ```

3. Now anyone writing with you can easily use these references in the project using the `[[cite:` prompt in Curvenote. Keep typing to search through your references dynamically, Curvenote will keep access to all sorts of metadata, including the abstract and DOI.

   ```{figure} paperpile/citations-refs.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 95%
   Search through your references as you are writing, and easily add your Paperpile references into your Curvenote articles.
   ```

Updating your reference list in Curvenote is simple. Just add or edit a reference to your Paperpile folder, then repeat steps 1 and 2 above. The new item will be integrated seamlessly into your references in the Curvenote web app as well as when you export to Microsoft Word, LaTeX, or PDF using Curvenote‚Äôs [professional templates](https://curvenote.com/templates).

Steps 1 and 2 offer a quick and easy way of creating a reference list for your Curvenote project in the web app. However, if you prefer to [work locally with Markdown](./working-locally-with-myst-markdown.md) and/or use the collaborative capabilities of GitHub, and would like your reference list in Curvenote to automatically update when you add a reference to Paperpile, read on!

## A step-by-step guide to synchronizing references with the Curvenote CLI and the Paperpile Export workflow (GitHub or a live link)

We describe how to set up Paperpile‚Äôs BibTeX Export workflow to Curvenote in three steps:

**Step 1: Clone your Curvenote project locally**

1. Install the Curvenote CLI with `npm install -g curvenote`, [detailed instructions are here](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli).
2. You can either choose to work with your Markdown (`.md`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files [from an existing Curvenote project](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/tutorial-deploy-project) or work with a [GitHub repository locally](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/tutorial-deploy-local). In this use-case, we clone a git repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sakelariev/curvenote.git blog
   Cloning into 'blog'...
   ```

3. Go to the folder that you have created using `cd <name_of_folder>` (`cd blog` in our example) and type `curvenote init`¬†to¬†create a local website of your project.

   ```{code-block} shell
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1,15,17
   > curvenote init
   Welcome to the Curvenote CLI!! üëã

   curvenote init walks you through creating a curvenote.yml file.

   You can use this client library to:

    - sync content to & from Curvenote
    - build & export professional PDFs
    - create a local website & deploy to https://sakelariev.curve.space

   Find out more here:
   https://curvenote.com/docs/cli

   ? What content would you like to use?
     Import from Curvenote
   ‚ùØ Use the content & notebooks in this folder
     - Show me some demo content! (Disabled)
   ```

4. Select `Use the content & notebooks in this folder`. Use the ‚ÜïÔ∏è arrow keys to change the selection.
5. Choose the title of your project/site.

   ```text
   ? What is the title of this project? (blog) blog
   ```

6. Start Curvenote to show a preview of your content locally by typing `Y`. You can also use `curvenote start` later to restart the server, this will bring up your content on a local website.

   ```{code-block} text
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12,19
   Curvenote setup is complete!! üöÄ

   You can use this client library to:

     - curvenote pull: Update your content to what is on https://curvenote.com
     - curvenote start: Start a local web server now!
     - curvenote deploy: Share content on https://sakelariev.curve.space

   Find out more here:
   https://curvenote.com/docs/cli

   ? Would you like to start a local server now? (Y/n) Y

           ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®  Starting Curvenote  ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

   üöÄ Built in 842ms

            üëâ  http://localhost:3000  üëà
   ```

**Step 2: Set up the BibTeX Export workflow in Paperpile**

1. Login to Paperpile and create a folder with the references that you‚Äôd like to export (see [](#managing-references) above!)

2. Click on the arrow next to the folder and select _Connect to Workflow._

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-connect-workflow.png
   :align: center
   :width: 95%
   Connect to workflow in Paperpile.
   ```

3. Go to _BibTeX Export_ and click _\+Add._

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-bibtex-workflow.png
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   Create a BibTeX export workflow in Paperpile.
   ```

4. Select _GitHub_, add the name of your repository and choose a name for the `.bib` file that you‚Äôd like to sync with the repository ([see Paperpile's GitHub documentation](https://paperpile.com/h/automatic-bibtex-export/))

5. Authorize the **paperpile-bot** to push your `.bib` file to the GitHub repository. Follow the instructions on the screen to add the **paperpile-bot** as a collaborator to the repository. Ensure that the **paperpile-bot** has _Write_ permissions (permissions can be changed under _Settings > Access > Collaborators and teams_ in GitHub).

   ```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-bot.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
   Activate the paperpile-bot in GitHub.
   ```

**Alternative: Use live link**

An alternative to pushing a BibTeX file to a GitHub repository is to export to a live link. The link works in the same way as the GitHub workflow, in that it will be updated when any changes to the folder associated with the workflow are made, but without the version control of GitHub. To get the link, after selecting the BibTeX Export workflow, select the Download Link option, choose a name for the `.bib` file, and click Finish. Then copy the link.

```{figure} paperpile/paperpile-live-link.png
:align: center
:width: 100%
Export to a live link.
```

**Step 3: Import the BibTeX file to your Curvenote project**

1. Return to your Curvenote project folder and open the `curvenote.yml` file using a text editor. Under `project`, add the `bibliography` option add the name of the `.bib` file. (If you have chosen the live link option, instead of typing the name of the `.bib` into the curvenote.yml file, copy the link from Paperpile‚Äôs BibTeX Export workflow, add the bibliography option to the .yml file, and paste the link there.)

   ```{code-block} yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5
   version: 1
   project:
     title: blog
     bibliography:
       - references.bib
   site:
     title: blog
     projects:
       - path: .
         slug: blog
   ```

2. Save the `curvenote.yml` file. On saving, Curvenote will rebuild your content automatically and you‚Äôll see a new line of code with your references (`üè´ Read 9 citations from references.bib`).

   ```{code-block} shell
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2
   üöÄ Rebuilding...
   üè´ Read 9 citations from references.bib in 39 ms.
   ‚öôÔ∏è  Writing site config.json
   üìñ Built my-first-notebook.ipynb in 16 ms.
   üìñ Built my-first-post.md in 152 ms.
   üìñ Built README.md in 17 ms.
   üìñ Built index.md in 18 ms.
   üìö Built 4 pages for blog in 67 ms.
   ```

3. Add citations directly in Markdown using `` {cite:t}`citation_key` `` (see the [MyST Markdown documentation on citations](https://www.myst.tools/docs/mystjs/citations)). BibTeX citation keys can be obtained from Paperpile (see the tips below).

   ```{figure} paperpile/myst-citation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   Create a citation in MyST Markdown.
   ```

4. This inserts your citation into the text and you also get a reference list at the bottom of the document. The citations are dynamic and expose metadata to ensure your scientific articles follow FAIR principles {cite:p}`Wilkinson2016FAIR` (üëà you can click on the citation!).

   ```{figure} paperpile/rendered-citation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 95%
   Rendered citations in your Curvenote site.
   ```

Now the best thing about Paperpile‚Äôs BibTeX Export workflow is that it is **dynamic**‚Äîevery time you add a new reference to your Paperpile folder, you‚Äôll be able to insert it as a citation to your Curvenote document given that you have fetched and pulled the latest changes locally. Once you have created a site with Curvenote, [deploy your Curvenote site from GitHub](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/github-action) or easily export your content to PDF, LaTeX or Word.

This makes the workflow really useful for collaborative projects where bibliographies need to be updated frequently‚Äîlike journal club websites, or laboratory group webpages.

```{tip}
# Other Tips!

- You can obtain a BibTeX citation key for any reference from Paperpile by selecting the reference, using _Ctrl-B_ to copy the BibTeX item to the clipboard, and clicking _View._
- An alternative way to create a bibliography for your Curvenote project is to generate a reference list using a Paperpile label. Labels allow you to organize your references by topic, and they can also be exported as `.bib` files, using the steps above.
- Have a complex project, like a thesis? You can add multiple Paperpile folders or labels to a Curvenote project in the web app. Simply generate a BibTeX file for each one and the references will be combined into one database in the Curvenote web app without duplication.
- Need to export a bibliography from the Curvenote web app and add the references to Paperpile? To export the BibTeX file from a Curvenote project, Click Download options > Export As > TEX. The `.bib` file will be included in the .zip file containing the LaTeX source files. Then upload the `.bib` file to Paperpile by selecting _Add papers > Upload files > Choose file(s)._
