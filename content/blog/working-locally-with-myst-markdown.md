# Working Locally With MyST Markdown

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:AVQ2dzLNloEd25Io8NbA/QfMbOBEtLQq6HjSBlzKT.1"}

We recently released the first version of the Curvenote command-line tools to work locally with content from Curvenote. You can read the documentation here: <https://curvenote.com/docs/web>. With the CLI, you can easily export an article to MyST Markdown, a new Markup language designed by [Executable Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) (we are on the [team](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/team.html)!) to create publication-quality, computational documents written entirely in Markdown.

Stay tuned for new ways to share and manage publication quality content on Curvenote. üöÄ

## Markedly Structured Text (MyST)

MyST (Markedly Structured Text) is designed to create publication-quality, computational documents written entirely in Markdown. The main community driving the development and design of MyST is [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/), which helps you create educational online textbooks and tutorials with Jupyter Notebooks and narrative content written in MyST. The MyST format has also been picked up in the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html) and [ReadTheDocs](https://blog.readthedocs.com/sphinx-markdown-2021/) communities as well, which are used primarily for Python software documentation (which previously would have used [ReStructured Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)). The fantastic thing about these communities is that there are ways to create new extensions and use these extensions _directly from the RST language_; this extensibility and community can now be harnessed through MyST Markdown!

MyST is a superset of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (the standard form of Markdown) and allows you to directly create ‚Äúdirectives‚Äù and ‚Äúroles‚Äù as extension points in the language. `directives` are block-level extension points, like callout panels, tabs, figures, or embedded charts; and `roles` are inline extension points, for components like references, citations, or inline math.

````html
```{directive} Argument The *content* of a directive can have {role}`with content` ```
````

If you want to dive deeper into the MyST syntax and features available, [see here](https://executablebooks.github.io/mystjs)! If you want to work with your Curvenote content locally, you can use the [command-line tools](https://docs.curvenote.com/cli) to either export or sync your content locally.

```shell
# Export a curvenote article as MyST Markdown üìú
curvenote export md [link]
# Or export as a JupyterBook  üìñ
curvenote export jupyter-book [link]
# Or export as a PDF! üìÑ
curvenote export pdf [link] -t arxiv_two_column
# Or work with **all** Curvenote features locally! üöÄ
curvenote init
```

The simplified authoring environment provided by MyST and the workflow tools that stitch together Notebooks into a published website, from a few lines of configuration, have been key to the adoption and use by the community. Scientists and researchers are using MyST to create projects from heliophysics to music classification. Curvenote is excited to support the project as it continues to evolve!

## MyST and Curvenote

As the Curvenote community grows, we want to make sure that these foundational tools and syntax are directly interoperable as they continue to evolve and support the diverse usage and needs of the wider scientific and data-science communities. Supporting MyST means that you can directly export your content as a JupyterBook (see [docs on export](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli/jupyter-book)), or copy MyST markdown directly in Curvenote when you are writing!

Directly copy any block as MyST Markdown
```

## Next Steps

Curvenote is currently helping lead an effort on standardizing and documenting some of the efforts behind the MyST language (aptly called [myst-spec](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-spec)) as well as a new library to bring these capabilities into Javascript (called [mystjs](https://executablebooks.github.io/mystjs/)). These open-source technologies are some of what is powering our new sites and this blog!

### MyST Playground

You can edit the content below to get a sense of how MyST works, we will be improving both MyST documentation and our own documentation on Curvenote over the coming weeks!

````rust
```{note}
This is a `note` "directive"
```

This is a {abbr}`MyST (Markedly Structured Text)` "role" that creates an abbreviation.
````

To get started with your Curvenote projects locally, you can use `curvenote clone [link]` after you install the [command line tools](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli/installing). Let us know how this works for you! üöÄ
