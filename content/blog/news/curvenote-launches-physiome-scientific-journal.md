Curvenote, a new publishing platform and writing tool designed for scientists in the age of open science, has launched their first [scientific journal with the Physiome Project](https://journal.physiomeproject.org). The open access journal, which focuses on mathematical models of physiological processes, aims to promote reproducibility and open science by incentivizing researchers to publish their computational models in a structured, web-based format that is accessible to all.

The Physiome Project is a well-established publisher of mathematical models of physiological processes, and the journal _Physiome_ complements the work already being done by the society to ensure reproducibility and reusability of mathematical models. The new journal uses Curvenote’s infrastructure for publishing, which has a focus on web-based articles, structured data, and interactive features for citations and cross-references.

“We are thrilled to be launching our first scientific journal in partnership with the Physiome Project.” said Dr. Rowan Cockett, CEO of Curvenote. “Our platform is designed to promote reproducibility, and we believe that this partnership will help reinforce open science principles. Curvenote helps scientists publish high-quality structured scientific articles at a lower cost, making it easier for researchers to focus on their work and effectively communicate their findings.”

Distinguished Professor Peter Hunter, Editor in Chief of _Physiome_, is also enthusiastic about the partnership. “We believe that _Physiome_ is an important step forward in promoting open science and reproducibility in the field of physiological modeling,” he said. “The journal provides a platform for researchers to publish their work in a way that is standardized, accessible, and transparent. We believe this is of great benefit to the whole scientific community.”

Dr. David Nickerson, Editor of the new journal and Senior Research Fellow at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland, added, “We are excited to be working with Curvenote to launch the _Physiome_. Our goal is to promote reproducibility and openness in science, and our partnership with Curvenote furthers these goals.”

The new journal builds upon the open-source MyST Markdown project (https://mystmd.org) for creating structured text from documents including $\LaTeX$, Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks. These next-generation authoring and publishing tools can be used directly by researchers, lowering the cost of publishing high-quality structured scientific articles.

The launch of this new journal is a significant step forward in the advancement of open science, reproducibility, and accessibility in scientific publishing. The Physiome Project and Curvenote are leading the way in making it easier for scientists to share their findings and collaborate with one another, ultimately leading to more significant advancements in scientific research.
