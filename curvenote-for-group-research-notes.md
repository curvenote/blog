# Curvenote for Group Research Notes

> Part of a series on Research Workflows using Curvenote, interviewing Dr. Lindsey Heagy. [Start at Part 1.](./research-workflows.md)

Lindsey also participates in the [SimPEG](https://curvenote.com/@simpeg) (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics) group - where the note taking process is even more complex.

“It’s a group of geoscientists who are using SimPEG, an open source software package for geophysics, for their work,” said Lindsey. “Folks are writing code, and showcasing different use cases from their research and applications, so we can improve the code base. This ensures SimPEG continues to serve everyone’s research within this space.”

The SimPEG group has adopted Curvenote for their weekly Wednesday meetings, where everyone showcases their work and any issues they’ve run into. The benefits have been numerous. For one, the SimPEG group has a centralized team profile - so anyone who misses a meeting can browse the week’s notes to catch up on what they missed. Curvenote also supports interactivity, so if a group member links to a Jupyter figure in the notes, it’ll stay interactive. It’s an accessible, interactive, and easy way for SimPEG to continue to build a light-weight open source community.

“There have been a couple scenarios that have been really fun to see,” said Lindsey. “There was a meeting a few weeks ago where somebody was prototyping new code, and wanted to talk about the implementation. So they linked their code directly into the group meeting notes.”

“Similarly, there are folks who have interesting research results they want to share. For example, maybe they have a figure they want to show off - and they can link to that directly in our meeting notes. It allows us to have an interesting collection of interactive scientific artifacts and ideas that different people have contributed to, but are all relevant to this one community.”
