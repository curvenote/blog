His mission is to make science user-friendly and accessible to everyone. “Every improvement in the user experience and communication of science means that a cure for a disease or progress towards climate action is a little bit easier, a little bit closer.” Dr. Morrison brings a wealth of experience and expertise to Curvenote and will play a key role in helping the company redesign science communication starting with the scientific paper.

“We are thrilled to have Mike join our team at Curvenote,” said CEO and co-founder, Dr. Rowan Cockett. “Mike is a leader in science communication and shares our passion for making science accessible. His experience and insights will be invaluable as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in science communication.”

At Curvenote, Mike will be responsible for leading the company's efforts to redesign the scientific paper, making it more user-friendly, engaging, and accessible to a wider audience. He will also work closely with the team to help researchers communicate their work more effectively, whether it's through posters, talks, journals, or other forms of scientific communication.
