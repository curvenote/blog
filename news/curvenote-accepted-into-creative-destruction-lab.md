Curvenote, a platform for collaborative writing, has been accepted into the prestigious Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), a nonprofit organization that offers an objectives-based program for science and technology-based companies. The CDL program is designed to help commercialize deep-tech ventures that have come from a university lab or similar, with a focus on streams such as energy, health, climate, quantum, and space.

“We are thrilled to have been selected to participate in the CDL program,” said Dr. Rowan Cockett, CEO and co-founder of Curvenote. “Our platform and the open source tools we support is built around our mission of supporting open science and reproducibility, and we believe that CDL's objectives-based program is the perfect fit for us. We are looking forward to working with CDL's team of mentors and investors to accelerate our growth and achieve our goals.”

Curvenote is a platform for collaborative writing that helps researchers and scientists write and publish reproducible papers. The platform integrates with popular tools like Jupyter and $\LaTeX$ to provide a seamless writing experience, with features like version control, commenting, and real-time collaboration. Curvenote is designed to make scientific writing more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative.

“Curvenote is all about making scientific writing more accessible and collaborative, and we believe that CDL’s program will help us achieve our mission,” said Steve Purves, CTO and co-founder of Curvenote. “We are excited to work with CDL's mentors and investors to refine our product, grow our user base, and bring reproducible scientific writing to a wider audience.”

CDL’s program is different from other innovation accelerators in that it focuses on objectives-based mentoring and networking. Each session is about eight weeks apart, and companies present their progress and objectives to a team of mentors, scientists, and MBA students. At the end of each session, the mentors vote to keep companies in the program for the next eight-week sprint, providing their time and connections to help them hit their goals.

“The quality of the mentors is world class and they are essentially voting with their time to help with insights, advice and connections,” said Dr. Cockett, “We are really excited to work with our mentors over the coming months as we expand Curvenote to researchers worldwide.”
