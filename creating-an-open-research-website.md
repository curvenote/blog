# Creating an Open Research Website

In this webinar we took the group through using the Curvenote CLI to create a local Markdown based authoring experience. This lets you work with local files and notebooks to customize settings, update and add content whilst having instant feedback via a preview of the website.

**To get started:**

- Try curvenote: <https://try.curvenote.com>
- Install the [command line tools](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli/installing)
- Follow the [tutorial to work locally](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/tutorial-deploy-local)

It is a complete tutorial, and the recording is available below (\~55 mins):
