# One Click Publishing for Open Research Websites

In this webinar, we walked through our one-click publishing features in Curvenoteâ€™s visual scientific editor which is accessible via your web browser at <https://curvenote.com>.

We show how you can easily publish and update scientific and technical content, manuscripts, and Jupyter Notebooks in a fast interactive site within a couple of minutes. Then with a little configuration via the user interface add rich metadata including authors, affiliations, open access badges, GitHub repositories, and clear licensing over content and code.

The video thumbnail has been placed right over the publishing button ðŸ˜¢. Weâ€™ll be aware of that for future webinars but hereâ€™s a screenshot of our Publish button in action, to show you what you are missing in the recording.

**Want to work locally in Markdown?**

As well as being able to publish a website from the Curvenote editor shown in this webinar. You can also work locally with Markdown files in your favorite text editor, using GitHub for version control, and even deploy sites from a GitHub action. To do this use the open source Curvenote CLI to build your site, run a local development web server and deploy to the Curvenote CDN - read the docs here: <http://curvenote.com/docs/web>
